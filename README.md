## Some details about the code above:
Need to download weights from the YOLOv3 website- https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/ and add the path similar in the script
Sample project for facial recognition with prediction of a person in the near future.
the above script is mainly scripted using TF-gpu version so kindly run on the desired packages.

Taking a person's height as a second filter will be able to guess the person's details and create a ledger to save his travel for further searches/safety.
The model will have filters to predict using height, facial detection and motion(future) of movement of a person.

The later stages of this classifier is to implement in rasberry pi and rate its efficiency. With deployment in flask so as to get a web application.
Also will implement CNN so as to keep learning with what so ever person seen to be added to the ledger and guess the person passing by the camera.
