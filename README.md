Sample project for facial recognition with prediction of a person in the near future.

Taking a person's height as a second filter will be able to guess the person's details and create a ledger to save his travel for further searches/safety.
The model will have filters to predict using height, facial detection and motion(future) of movement of a person.

The later stages of this classifier is to implement in rasberry pi and rate its efficiency. With deployment in flask so as to get a web application.
Also will implement CNN so as to keep learning with what so ever person seen to be added to the ledger and guess the person passing by the camera.
